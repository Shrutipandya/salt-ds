The Salt design system enables teams to modify design variables and theme projects to their requirements. Understanding how Salt structures and manages these design variables will help you create consistent themes for your project.

## What a theme is

A theme is a controlled change (or series of changes) to the design system's default design lanugage. The goal is to change the system's look and feel to better fit with alternative established guidelines.

## When to theme

Salt offers a consistent design language ready for teams to use in their projects. Theming is not mandatory, but it can help a team meet their project's requirements.

Before theming, consider these three questions:

1. Is the default Salt design language unsuitable for my project?
2. Do I have a set of alternative design guidelines to follow?
3. Does my project need to follow those guidelines?

If the answer to all three is "yes," theming may be suitable for your project.

## How to theme

Theming should aim to maintain a consistent look and feel. Salt is designed to ensure visual consistency, and understanding how Salt achieves this is key to producing consistent themes. 

While users can modify individual components to meet their needs, this can create inconsistencies as users have to remember to apply changes where relevant to other components. Salt's tokens make it easier to apply changes while maintaining consistency.

### What a token is

A token stores design decisions. Multiple components can use the same token to ensure a given design decision applies consistently across the design system.

An example of a token is `--salt-status-error-foreground`. This token is used to set the foreground color when a component communicates an error message. That means both `Dialog` and `Toast` can use this token to set the foreground color when necessary.

While a user could change the status foreground color for `Toast`, this wouldn't change the corresponding color for the `Dialog` component. Changing the color associated with the `--salt-status-error-foreground` token ensures that both componenents, and any others that refer to the token, all use the same color in the given context.

### Benefits of tokens

Tokens offer several benefits:

- Streamlined design changes that automatically apply to related components
- Increased consistency across all components, improving the overall user experience
- Simplified approach when adding new components or patterns
- Single reference points for commonly-used values

### Which tokens to modify

Salt is under active development, and future versions may modify the token list. Some tokens, however, are less likely to change than others.

Salt's tokens are organized into three tiers. From most generalized to most specific, the tiers are:

1. Foundational tokens
2. Palette tokens
3. Characteristic tokens

The characteristic tokens are likely to experience the fewest changes.

## Token tiers explained

Salt's token tiers indicate the purpose of a token and how it is used in the design system. Tokens can reference each other and inherit values, so a token from one tier can provide information to another.

Take the status characteristic tokens as an example. Components like [`Toast`](/salt/components/toast/examples) use these tokens to denote status using color, such as a green foreground color to denote success.

1. The component uses the `--salt-status-success-foreground` characteristic token. This token has the default value `var(--salt-palette-success-foreground)`.
2. The characteristic token references the palette token `--salt-palette-success-foreground`. This token has the default value `var(--salt-color-green-400)`.
3. The palette token references the foundational token `--salt-color-green-400`. This token has the default value `rgb(48, 156, 90)`.

Characteristics are both light/dark and density sensitive. That means the value the characteristic points to will change according to the values given in the nearest `SaltProvider`.

As an example, `--salt-actionable-primary-background` resolves to `var(--salt-palette-interact-primary-background)`. In the light theme, this palette token has the value `var(--salt-color-gray-60)`. In the dark theme, the value is `var(--salt-color-gray-300)`. Foundational tokens then resolve to their respective RGBA values.
