### Using the component

#### When to use

- To expose a set of preconfigured secondary actions or commands that are relevant to a specific task. You would typically use it in conjunction with more complex UIs, such as data grids, text editors or dashboards which support a large number of functions and actions.
- To present users with multiple actions that are related to each other, like “Undo” or “Redo” and will dismiss once they have selected an action.

#### When not to use

- As a primary navigation method in your application. Instead, refer to the navigation pattern.
- To display actions that are not relevant to the use case. For example, if your menu is contextual to a grid cell, “Save” or “Print” actions are likely to be irrelevant. Instead, use X.
