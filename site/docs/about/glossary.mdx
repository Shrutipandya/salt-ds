Below are definitions of terms commonly used in Salt design system content, communications and documentation.

## Breakpoint

In responsive design, a breakpoint is the viewport width at which a layout will adapt in order to provide the best possible user experience.

## Density

Density relates to the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the size and spacing of components.

The Salt design system supports four base densities: high, medium, low and touch. Read more in the [density foundation](/salt/foundations/density).

## Disabled state

A component in a disabled state (like a checkbox or radio button) is not interactive or focusable. This is different from a [read-only](#read-only) state as the user cannot interact with any accompanying text.

## Foundation

A guide to fundamental principles that help create a cohesive design language.

## Object positioning

The below terms describe how objects are positioned, like within `FlexLayout`.

### Alignment

The positioning of object(s) along a given axis or line. "Start," "end," "left" and "right" are all alignments.

### Direction

The path of travel that object(s) will take. "Left-to-right" and "right-to-left" are directions.

Words typically used to describe orientation can also describe direction in limited cases. Where setting the language as LTR or RTL changes the order of objects, "horizontal" and "vertical" also become directions. This is consistent with the CSS flexbox layout, where the `flex-direction` property accepts `row` or `column` and the direction of objects is determined by whether the language is LTR or RTL.

### Justification

The spacing between a series of objects.

### Orientation

The rotational position of the object(s) as a whole in relation to another point. "Horizontal" and "vertical" are orientations.

## Pattern

A design solution that helps users complete common tasks. Salt offers a set of composable components that are the building blocks of patterns.

## Read-only state

A component in a read-only state (like a checkbox or radio button) is navigable using keyboard shortcuts, but the user cannot edit any relevant values or directly change its state. This is different from a [disabled](#disabled) state as the user can interact with accompanying text in limited ways.

## Responsive prop

In resposive design, a responsive prop is one that takes either multiple values (one value per [breakpoint](#breakpoint)) or a single value that would take effect across all screen sizes. `FlexLayout` supports responsive props.

## Salt

The J.P. Morgan design system, an open-source solution for building exceptional products and digital experiences in financial services and other industries.

## Status

A status prop visually modifies a component to more effectively communicate a message. Statuses are typically listed in info-red-amber-green order. You can find statuses in `Tooltip`, `Dialog`, `Banner` and `Toast`.

### Info

An info status is used to display general information. When the information concerns a successful action, a success status is more appropriate.

### Error

An error status communicates a critical issue that prevents the user for continuing. When the issue does not prevent the user from completing their task, a warning status is more appropriate.

### Warning

A warning status informs users of an issue or potential issue related to their current task. It's used for issues that do not prevent the user from continuing or completing their task. When the issue prevents the user from completing their task, an error warning is more appropriate.

### Success

A success status confirms that a user's action has been completed successfully.

## Token

A token stores design decisions in a single place, enabling teams to use them across their project to create consistent experiences.
