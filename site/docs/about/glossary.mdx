Below are definitions of terms commonly used in Salt design system content, communications and documentation.

## Glossary

### Foundation

A guide to fundamental principles that help create a cohesive design language.

### Object positioning

These terms describe how objects are positioned, like within `FlexLayout`.

#### Alignment

The positioning of object(s) along a given axis or line. "Start," "end," "left" and "right" are all alignments.

#### Direction

The path of travel that object(s) will take. "Left-to-right" and "right-to-left" are directions.

Words typically used to describe orientation can also describe direction in limited cases. Where setting the language as LTR or RTL changes the order of objects, "horizontal" and "vertical" also become directions. This is consistent with the CSS flexbox layout, where the `flex-direction` property accepts `row` or `column` and the direction of objects is determined by whether the language is LTR or RTL.

#### Justification

The spacing between a series of objects.

#### Orientation

The rotational position of the object(s) as a whole in relation to another point. "Horizontal" and "vertical" are orientations.

### Pattern 

A design solution that helps users complete common tasks. Salt offers a set of composable components that are the building blocks of patterns.

### Responsive property

A property that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint), or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes.

### Salt

The J.P. Morgan design system, an open-source solution for building exceptional products and digital experiences in financial services and other industries.

### Status

A status prop visually modifies a component to more effectively communicate a message. You can typically find statuses in `Tooltip`, `Dialog`, `Banner` and `Toast`.

#### Info

An info status is used to display general information. When the information concerns a successful action, a success status is more appropriate.

#### Error

An error status communicates a critical issue that prevents the user for continuing. When the issue does not prevent the user from completing their task, a warning status is more appropriate.

#### Warning

A warning status informs users of an issue or potential issue related to their current task. It's used for issues that do not prevent the user from continuing or completing their task. When the issue prevents the user from completing their task, an error warning is more appropriate.

#### Success

A success status confirms that a user's action has been completed successfully.

### Token

A token stores design decisions in a single place, enabling teams to use them across their project to create consistent experiences.
